Obstacles Avoiding Robot 
How Ultrasonic Sensor can be used to Avoid Obstacles Before going to build the robot, it is important to understand how the ultrasonic sensor works because this sensor will have important role in detecting obstacle. The basic principle behind the working of ultrasonic sensor is to note down the time taken by sensor to transmit ultrasonic beams and receiving the ultrasonic beams after hitting the surface. Then further the distance is calculated using the formula. In this project, the widely available HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is used. To use this sensor, similar approach will be followed explained above. So, the Trig pin of HC-SR04 is made high for at least 10 us. A sonic beam is transmitted with 8 pulses of 40KHz each.

The signal then hits the surface and return back and captured by the receiver Echo pin of HC-SR04. The Echo pin had already made high at the time sending high.
